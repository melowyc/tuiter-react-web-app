                <p class="wd-image-p1">NBA Twitter reacts to Brooklyn Nets trading Kyrie Irving to the Mavericks</p>
                <p class="wd-image-p2">After Kyrie Irving’s trade request became public news on Friday, it was only a matter of time before Irving was traded given the circumstances. When the news dropped on Sunday that the Brooklyn Nets traded Kyrie Irving to the Dallas Mavericks for Spencer Dinwiddie, Dorian Finney-Smith, and picks, it appeared to set Twitter ablaze.
                    From pundits to players, it looks like everyone had something additional to report on the fallout of the trade or wanted to give their own reaction to the transaction. Irving has had NBA Twitter waiting under baited breath to see what the Nets were going to do regarding Irving’s trade demand. There were some who thought that Brooklyn was just calling Irving’s bluff or that the Nets would just hold onto Irving in order to keep Durant happy.</p>
